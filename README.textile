h1. Shifter Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Shifter plugin":http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/index?pr=&pluginId=6149
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IDEA, PhpStorm, AppCode, etc.



h2. Description

The Shifter plugin is helpful for quickly manipulating various patterns of code (keywords of multiple types), 
hopefully sparing the lazy programmer from some manual typing ;)

Shifter adds the following editing tools:

* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Comma  - Shift Down
* Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Period - Shift Up

When evoked, shifter detects the type of keyword at caret and shifts it "up" or "down".
If there's only one shiftable word in a line, it can be shifted without the caret touching it.
Lowercase/uppercase or lower case with upper first character of shifted words is maintained.


Supported shifting / keyword types:

* Shifting a multi-line selection sorts the lines alphabetically ascending/descending.
* Shifting a single-line selection, that is a comma separated list, sorts the items ascending/descending.
* Boolean values - Toggles true/false, on/off, yes/no (e.g. Objective-C), shown/hidden, positive/negative
* Numeric values - Increments/decrements numbers by 1
* UNIX timestamps - Increments/decrements by one day, shows a balloon info with the shifted date in human-readable format
* PHP variables - Shifts to alphabetically next/previous variable name found in current document
* PHP core magical constants - Shifts PHP's magic constants (__FILE__, __LINE__, etc.)
* Strings wrapped in single/double quotes and backticks - Shifts to alphabetically next/previous quoted string found in current document
* CSS hex RGB colors - Shifts color value lighter/darker
* CSS pixel values - Shifts px-values up/down by 1
* CSS orientations and positioning: top/right/bottom/left and absolute/relative
* Accessibility types: public/private/protected
* MySql data types: Shifts to next bigger/smaller numeric/string type
* Primitive data types of Java, JavaScript, PHP, Objective-C
* Doc comment tags (Java, JavaScript, PHP)
* JavaScript event types (mouse, keyboard, frame/object, form)
* Named colors from the sRGB color space (white, lightgray, gray...)
* Names of common data collection types (list, set, bag, dictionary, tree, etc.)
* Full and abbreviated names of months and weekdays (english)
